/* Route the job to a slot. Preferences, in order:
 *   1. A live-tool-state continuation binds to the slot that owns its call

 *      A continuation whose prompt cannot fit its owner slot's context can
 *      never run: it must not run elsewhere (the live tool state exists only
 *      on the owner), and leaving it queued would wedge the FIFO forever
 *      behind an unbindable head — so it is failed explicitly through
 *      *reject_ctx with the same context_length_exceeded client error the
 *      front door sends (http_server.c / request_exceeds_context; the front
 *      door checks against slot 0's ctx and cannot see the owner's smaller
 *      one).
 *   2. A free fitting slot whose live thinking binding byte-matches the
 *      request's visible transcript is that conversation's warm continuation
 *      and wins outright (thinking_live_binds_prompt): for thinking chats
 *      the client replays visible content while the slot's frontier holds
 *      the hidden reasoning, so the token common prefix understates
 *      relatedness and must not out-vote the binding.
 *   3. Among free slots with enough context, the longest common token prefix
 *      wins, keeping a client's follow-ups on their warm KV.
 *   4. A job whose best token match is TRIVIAL — header-deep only, against a
 *      slot holding meaningful warm state past the match
 *      (server_slot_match_is_trivial) — prefers a fresh lazily provisioned
 *      slot over clobbering that conversation (budget permitting); with the
 *      pool exhausted it falls back to the warmest free slot exactly like
 *      the single-session server did. (Through v0.2.0 this gate required
 *      common == 0, which rendered chat traffic can never produce — every
 *      rendered prompt shares the template header, measured 4–9 common
 *      tokens across distinct conversations — so sequential conversations
 *      always clobbered slot 0 and the pool never provisioned; task #24
 *      bounce repro, fixed in task #30.)
 * Returns NULL when the job must wait for a slot to free — except when
 * *reject_ctx is set nonzero (the owner slot's ctx_size), which means the
 * job can never run and must be failed, not left queued. *waiting_owner is
 * set when the NULL means "the continuation's owner slot is busy": eviction
 * cannot help that job, only the owner finishing can. *clobbers is set when
 * the returned slot would overwrite another conversation's warm KV — the
 * caller may prefer evict(LRU)+provision over that (increment 4). *refusal
 * reports why a fresh provisioning was refused (PROVISION_OK when none was

/* =========================================================================
 * Increment 4: LRU eviction of idle slots.
 *
 * Sessions were previously never freed at runtime: once the admission budget
 * was consumed by idle-but-warm sessions, new conversations either queued
 * forever (no fitting free slot) or silently clobbered the warmest idle slot
 * chosen by scan order. Now, when the queue head cannot be placed cleanly —
 * no fitting free slot, or only a slot whose warm KV belongs to another
 * conversation — AND provisioning was refused by a constraint eviction can
 * actually relieve (a full pool or a full admission ledger), the worker
 * evicts the least-recently-serviced IDLE slot: snapshot its KV to the disk
 * kv cache (the same LRU store used for shutdown/cold checkpoints — plan
 * Tier 1 §1.3 "spill target"), free the session, release its ACTUAL
 * committed bytes from the ledger, and retry placement (the freed budget +
 * slot entry let provisioning succeed). The clobber fallback remains when
 * eviction cannot help: it is an in-place eviction of that one slot
 * (gen_begin disk-stores the displaced state), so correctness is identical —
 * LRU eviction just picks a better victim and keeps warmer conversations
 * alive.
 *
 * MemAvailable-floor refusals deliberately do NOT trigger eviction. Measured
 * on the GB10 (driver 610, 2026-07-14 smoke): freeing two 2.5 GiB sessions
 * moved MemAvailable only 5.98 -> 6.07 GiB — cudaFree'd memory does not
 * promptly return to the kernel's gauge, so post-eviction provisioning kept
 * refusing on the same floor while two warm conversations were lost for
 * nothing (and the server degraded to one effective slot). A floor refusal
 * means the machine is physically tight; the honest response is to queue the
 * head until a slot frees, not to churn snapshots.
 *
 * Restore path: none of it is new. gen_begin's cache resolution already
 * prefers a disk-text snapshot over cold prefill (kv_cache_try_load), and the
 * "evict" snapshot is keyed exactly like a shutdown checkpoint — by rendered
 * transcript bytes, or by the visible protocol transcript when a live
 * responses/thinking binding covers the frontier. A returning client binds to
 * any free slot and restores from disk there; no extra routing metadata is
 * needed because the kvstore's text-prefix index IS the metadata. Live
 * tool-state continuations of an evicted slot get the protocol's honest 409
 * (their sampled frontier is gone), exactly like a server restart.
 *
 * Slot 0 is PINNED — never evicted: (a) client threads read
 * pulsar_session_ctx(s->sess) lock-free (http_server.c) under the
 * CUDA-state audit's immutable-after-startup exception, so freeing that
 * session would be a data race; (b) slot 0 is the only slot guaranteed to fit
 * any admissible request (job_needed_ctx caps at its ctx), which preserves
 * the scheduler invariant that an all-idle pool always binds the head (the
 * worker sleeps on the condvar when nothing is active) and guarantees the
 * pool never reaches zero slots; (c) as the largest session it is the most
 * expensive one to bring back. When small sessions need room, evicting the
 * idle secondaries (this code) frees the same budget without touching it.
 *
 * Like lazy provisioning, eviction is a deliberate multi-second quantum
 * overshoot on the single GPU worker thread: the snapshot forces a full
 * device sync + a multi-GiB D2H copy + a disk write, and pulsar_session_free
 * tears down the graph. It happens only at a scheduling boundary (bind time),
 * and only when the alternative is queueing forever.
