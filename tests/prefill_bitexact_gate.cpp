/* PREFILL BIT-EXACTNESS gate (the D2R tensor-core gate).
 *
 * MODEL-DEPENDENT: this gate freezes the ENGINE's full-vocab frontier logits
 * after a from-scratch prefill at several depths and byte-compares them against
 * a blob dumped by a BASELINE build (by default `dev` @ 8aa9d35, built in a
 * git worktree — see the `cuda-prefill-gate-baseline` Makefile target).  It is
 * the acceptance gate for the D2R (dequant-to-register) tensor-core MoE work:
 * every D2R increment claims to be BIT-EXACT, not merely close, so the gate's
 * tolerance is ZERO BYTES.  Run manually on the GB10 via `make cuda-prefill-gate`
 * (see the Makefile target for the memory discipline) — it is NOT part of
 * `make test`.
 *
 * WHY BYTE-COMPARE IS LEGITIMATE HERE.  Prefill is deterministic by
 * construction: the MoE path uses per-pair stores into a flat `down` buffer
 * plus a fixed-order `moe_sum_kernel` and NO float atomicAdd, precisely so
 * float reduction order cannot vary with tile scheduling
 * (src/cuda/pulsar_cuda_moe.cu — "no atomicAdd so numerics stay run-to-run
 * deterministic").  Check (c) below re-asserts that property every run; if a
 * future change reintroduces a float atomic, (c) fails before the byte-compare
 * has a chance to produce a confusing result.
 *
 * WHY FULL-VOCAB LOGITS AND NOT ARGMAX.  Our own 2026-07 IMMA post-mortem
 * (memory ds4-prefill-tensorcore) found argmax PRESERVED (494 == 494) while
 * late-layer hidden states diverged ~40% and the KV cache was materially
 * changed — generation drifted a few tokens later.  An argmax or top-k gate is
 * blind to exactly the failure that killed that attempt.  Full-vocab bytes at
 * MULTIPLE depths is the cheapest probe that is not.
 *
 * WHAT THE DEPTHS BUY.  With opt.prefill_chunk pinned to 4096,
 * pulsar_session_create computes prefill_cap = pulsar_prefill_cap_for_prompt(ctx_size,
 * 4096) = 4096 (src/engine/session.c:1813, src/engine/layers.c:14) — note it is
 * derived from ctx_size at CREATE, so it is 4096 for every depth here, not a
 * function of the prompt.  pulsar_session_sync then tests `prefill_cap <
 * prompt->len` (session.c:2063):
 *   - 512/2048/4096  -> FALSE (4096 included, at the boundary): the NON-chunked
 *     one-shot gpu_graph_prefill_raw_swa path.  Depth D is a single routed-MoE
 *     call at n_tokens == D.
 *   - 4102/6144      -> TRUE: gpu_graph_prefill_chunked, i.e. SEVERAL routed-MoE
 *     calls whose batch shapes are set by the chunk loop rather than by D.
 * The 6144 row is why the chunked path is not a blind spot: production chunks
 * every prompt > 4096, the cold chunk loop trims each non-final chunk to the
 * compress-ratio LCM and leaves a REMAINDER chunk (session.c:3476), and resumed
 * chunks re-shape batches and thereby change cuBLASLt algo selection
 * (session.c:3460).  A D2R re-tiling bug confined to chunk-remainder shapes
 * would pass a three-depth {512,2048,4096} gate and ship.
 * The 4102 row exists because 6144 was NOT enough: its remainder is 2048, so
 * every row above leaves a final chunk of 512..4096 and the gate never saw a
 * NARROW last chunk.  n_tok 1..8 is a distinct dispatch regime — the GEMV caps
 * switch there — and a change that moved every logit at n_tok=6 passed all four
 * original depths.  4102 gives a 6-token final chunk.  See g_depths below.
 * All depths clear the `use_big_batch = ... && n_tokens >= 128` bar in
 * routed_moe (src/cuda/pulsar_cuda_moe.cu) — including every chunk of the 6144 row
 * — i.e. they exercise the expert-tiled rowspan/tile16 kernels that D2R
 * replaces, NOT the per-pair qwarp32 decode path.  The ONE exception is 4102's
 * 6-token final chunk, which falls UNDER that bar and is the only row here that
 * reaches the small-batch path — deliberately so, since that is the regime the
 * n_tok-conditional dispatches select on.  Every routed layer runs on every
 * token, so all depths cover BOTH the 12 MXFP4 (type-39) promoted layers AND
 * the 31 IQ2_XXS (type-16) floor layers of v5mx in every run; the depths vary
 * the tile occupancy and the expert-tile remainder shapes, not the format
 * coverage.
 *
 * ...WHICH IS WHY THE ENV IS SCRUBBED.  That coverage claim is only true at the
 * DEFAULT env.  PULSAR_MOE_FP4_TILED=0 (src/cuda/pulsar_cuda_moe.cu, static-cached
 * getenv) forces use_sorted_pairs=0 for both-mxfp4 layers, so all 12 type-39
 * layers fall back to the per-pair qwarp32 path.  Exported for BOTH the dump and
 * the check, that would make the gate agree with itself having never run the
 * MXFP4 tiled kernels at all — a vacuous PASS.  scrub_numerics_env() below
 * unsets that whole class of knob and says so loudly — the whole PULSAR_ namespace,
 * plus the numerics knobs that live OUTSIDE it and are read by cuBLAS/the CUDA
 * runtime rather than by our code (NVIDIA_TF32_OVERRIDE, CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG),
 * which no namespace sweep could find.  (Differing env between dump and check
 * fails LOUD, which is the safe direction; the danger is only the SAME wrong env
 * on both sides.)
 *
 * Checks, per depth D in {512, 2048, 4096, 6144}:
 *   (a) full-vocab frontier logits after a from-scratch prefill of D tokens
 *       byte-match the baseline blob's row for D.  ZERO tolerance.
 *   (b) the blob header (logits width, depth list, FNV-1a of the token ids)
 *       matches the baseline's, so a re-tokenization or a different model
 *       fails LOUD instead of silently comparing the wrong thing.
 *   (c) run-to-run determinism: D is prefilled TWICE through two fresh
 *       sessions and the two rows must be byte-identical.  This is the guard
 *       against a reintroduced float atomicAdd or a schedule-dependent
 *       reduction; it holds independently of the baseline.
 *
 * WHICH REDUCTION ORDER ACTUALLY MATTERS (measured 2026-07-15, and NOT what
 * temp/d2r-prefill-spec.md section 3.1 predicts — read this before writing a
 * D2R kernel).  Each gate/up output element is a THREE-level float reduction
 * (moe_gate_up_mid_mxfp4_expert_ntile_rowspan_kernel + the blockN dot):
 *
 *   level 1  facc_b   = SUM over sb=0..7 of scale_sb * (float)sumi_sb
 *   level 2  g_l      = SUM over b == l (mod 8), ascending, of 0.5f*y->d*facc_b
 *   level 3  out      = quarter_warp_sum_f32's butterfly over l=0..7
 *                       i.e. ((g0+g4)+(g2+g6)) + ((g1+g5)+(g3+g7))
 *
 * The spec constrains ONLY level 1 ("keep sb ascending and it is bit-exact").
 * That is backwards on both counts:
 *   - Level 1 is order-INSENSITIVE over a provable window.  Every term is an
 *     exact power of two (E8M0) times an integer with |sumi| <= 32*12*127 =
 *     48768 (2^15.57).  facc sums EIGHT of them, so in units of the smallest
 *     scale the partial sums are integers bounded by 8*48768*2^k = 390144*2^k
 *     (2^18.57 * 2^k) for a scale spread of k octaves.  Exact integers in float
 *     run to 2^24, so the fold is provably exact — hence order-independent —
 *     while k <= 5.  Beyond that it MAY round (k=6 reaches 2^24.57); it is then
 *     data-dependent, not licensed.  Real weight rows keep neighbouring 32-block
 *     scales close, and measured on v5mx reversing sb moves ZERO bits of ZERO
 *     logits (the positive control below) — but do not read that as a licence to
 *     reorder level 1 unconditionally: the guarantee stops at 5 octaves.
 *   - IQ2_XXS is a SEPARATE case, and weaker: its reduction is integer
 *     (bsum += sumi*ls) and therefore exact and order-free as int32, with no
 *     overflow (|bsum| <= 8*32*43*127*31 = 43,338,496 << 2^31).  But that bound
 *     is 2^25.37, i.e. ABOVE 2^24 — so accumulating bsum in FLOAT is not
 *     provably exact, it merely happens not to round on this model.  Keep bsum
 *     integer; the int32 fold is both exact and faster.
 *   - Levels 2 and 3 ARE order-sensitive and the spec does not mention them.
 *     Their terms are 0.5f * y->d * facc_b with y->d an ARBITRARY float (the
 *     q8_K block scale, not a power of two), so those sums round.  Note also
 *     that 0.5f*y->d is applied PER BLOCK: SUM_b (0.5*d*facc_b) is not the same
 *     float as 0.5*d*SUM_b(facc_b).
 * A D2R re-tiling changes precisely the level-2/3 lane->block mapping, so that
 * is both what binds and the realistic failure mode — hence the teeth below.
 *
 * TEETH (each seeded as a local kernel edit, gate re-run, edit reverted;
 * verified on this tree 2026-07-15 — see the commit message):
 *   T1  MXFP4 gate/up block->lane REPARTITION — src/cuda/pulsar_cuda_moe.cu,
 *       moe_gate_up_mid_mxfp4_expert_ntile_rowspan_kernel: give lane l the
 *       blocks {2l, 2l+1} instead of {l, l+8}
 *           for (uint32_t b = lane * 2u; b < lane * 2u + 2u && b < xq_blocks; b++)
 *       At v5mx's xq_blocks == 16 (n_embd 4096 / 256) that is the SAME blocks
 *       and the same weights, with only the level-2/3 grouping moved — the
 *       cleanest possible probe of the reduction order.  (The seed is written
 *       for 16; at xq_blocks > 16 it would also drop blocks 16.. and become a
 *       wrong-answer seed rather than a pure repartition.)
 *       -> gate FAILS on the 12 type-39 layers.
 *   T2  IQ2_XXS gate/up block->lane repartition — the same edit in
 *       moe_gate_up_mid_expert_tile8_rowspan_kernel.
 *       -> gate FAILS on the 31 type-16 layers.
 *       (T1+T2 together also prove BOTH tiled kernels are actually launched at
 *       these depths, i.e. the coverage claim above is real and not dead code.)
 *
 * Measured 2026-07-15 on v5mx (ds4flash.gguf), baseline dev @ 8aa9d35:
 *   T1 -> 129280/129280 logits differ at depth 512, worst |delta| 1.50
 *   T2 -> 129279/129280 logits differ at depth 512, worst |delta| 1.66
 *   PC -> byte-identical at all depths
 * Liveness was cross-checked with a GROSS seed (scale the block8 result by 2):
 * it FAILS for both tiled kernels, while the same seed in the single-block
 * dev_dot_mxfp4_q8_K_block (the per-pair qwarp32 dot) PASSES — i.e. prefill at
 * these depths runs the TILED kernels and not the qwarp32 path, exactly as the
 * coverage argument claims.
 *
 *   POSITIVE CONTROL (not teeth — this one must PASS): reversing the `sb` loop
 *   in dev_dot_mxfp4_q8_K_block8 (7..0 instead of 0..7) changes the level-1
 *   float chain and PASSES, because level 1 is exactly representable (above).
 *   Keep it: T1/T2 with the control together show the gate is sensitive to the
 *   reductions that genuinely round and correctly INSENSITIVE to a provably
 *   exact reorder — it measures the right thing, not merely "any change at
 *   all".  A gate that failed the control would be over-tight and would block
 *   legitimate D2R freedom.
 *
 * WHY THE BLOB CARRIES A BUILD REF.  Nothing else in the blob identifies WHICH
 * BUILD produced it — prompt_fnv hashes only token ids, which are identical for
 * every engine build.  Without a ref, the obvious debugging move
 * (`--dump` over the default baseline path, from the tree under test) silently
 * re-baselines the gate against ITSELF, and it then prints PASS forever, output
 * indistinguishable from a real pass.  So the Makefile compiles the dumping
 * binary with -DPULSAR_GATE_BUILD_REF=<git short HEAD of the tree that built it>,
 * the blob records it, and --check REQUIRES the caller to state the ref it
 * expects (the Makefile passes PREFILL_BASELINE_REF).  A self-baseline from a
 * D2R commit then fails LOUD instead of passing vacuously.
 * Residual hole, stated honestly: while HEAD *is* the baseline ref (i.e.
 * Increment 0 itself, before any D2R commit lands), a self-dump records the same
 * ref and is indistinguishable.  That window closes as soon as the first D2R
 * commit moves HEAD — which is exactly when the gate starts carrying real load.
 *
 * usage: ./tests/prefill_bitexact_gate MODEL --dump  FILE
 *        ./tests/prefill_bitexact_gate MODEL --check FILE EXPECTED_BASELINE_REF
 *        ./tests/prefill_bitexact_gate MODEL --check-reference REF.bin TOKENS.bin [KL_TOL]
 *        (from the repo root — reads tests/long_context_story_prompt.txt;
 *         or `make cuda-prefill-gate` / `make cuda-prefill-gate-baseline`)

/* ---- --check-reference: divergence vs an EXTERNAL engine's logits ----------
 *
 * The blob here is NOT one of ours: it comes from the official checkpoint served
 * by a second engine (vLLM on a rented box — see
 * pulsar-notes/reference-capture/README.md for the capture protocol and the
 * 2026-08-21 blobs).  That changes three contracts relative to --check-fidelity:
 *
 *   1. TOKEN AUTHORITY IS A FILE.  The gate's own tokenizer path
 *      (pulsar_tokenize_text) and the CLI's --dump-tokens path produce
 *      DIFFERENT id streams for the same text (measured 2026-08-20: fnv
 *      0xfba1... vs 0x1a55... over the same 6144-token prefix), so
 *      re-tokenizing here would silently compare against the wrong prompt.
 *      Both sides prefill ids loaded from the SAME tokens.bin (int32 LE); the
 *      blob's prompt_fnv over the deepest depth is required to match the
 *      file's, so a wrong pairing fails loud before the model loads.
 *   2. SHAPES DIFFER.  The reference row width is the true vocab (129,280);
 *      ours is pulsar_engine_logits_width, a padded stride.  Depths come from
 *      the REFERENCE header (it carries rows past GATE_CTX, e.g. 30464), and
 *      the compare runs over min(ref_width, our_width) columns — the padded
 *      tail lanes carry no information and are excluded.
 *   3. NO PROVENANCE REF, NO TEETH BY DEFAULT.  build_ref in a reference blob
 *      names the other engine ("vllm-0.27.1"), printed but not matched — the
 *      self-baseline attack --check guards against cannot arise from a blob we
 *      cannot produce.  Without [KL_TOL] the mode is REPORT-ONLY (exit 0
 *      unless infrastructure fails): the first run against a new reference
 *      ESTABLISHES the divergence budget, it does not enforce one.  With
 *      [KL_TOL] it enforces top-1 match + KL <= tol per depth, same as
 *      --check-fidelity.
 *
 * What the number means: this reference is MATCHED-PRECISION cross-engine
 * (the checkpoint ships MXFP4 experts; there is no higher-precision release),
 * so KL here is divergence-from-another-implementation on identical weights —
 * decisive for changes to OUR arithmetic (fast-math, accumulation formats,
 * storage narrowing: L072/L045/L079), a budget anchor rather than an oracle
 * for quant-quality absolutes.  Determinism re-runs are skipped: that property
 * belongs to --check, and doubling a 30k-token prefill buys nothing here. */

     * type-40 W4A8 bundle (KL 0.007) and that analogy does not hold at shallow
     * depth.
     *
     * Measured for the f32->BF16 HC residual carrier change: KL 2.31e-2 at depth
     * 512, but 1e-7..1e-8 at 2048/4096/6144. Top-1 preserved at EVERY depth and
     * run-to-run determinism intact. The shape is the tell: depth 512 has the
     * SMALLEST logit RMS (0.32 vs 0.74-1.41 deeper) yet by far the LARGEST KL —
     * a shallow, sharply-peaked distribution amplifies an identical perturbation,
     * so a single flat KL bound is simply the wrong instrument there.
     *
     * The deeper reason this is not a real regression: the source model is
     * `torch_dtype: bfloat16`, so our f32 residual was OVER-precision, not
     * fidelity. This KL is divergence from our own over-precise baseline, NOT
     * error against the reference — the standing trap noted in
     * [[ds4-workrig-collection-list]], where measuring divergence-from-ourselves
     * always favours the incumbent. A 3-trial sampled A/B (T=0.95, seeds 42/43/
     * 44) scored f32 83/93/87 vs BF16 90/90/93; since the spread on a single
     * UNCHANGED build of that suite is 10 points, the honest read is "not worse",
     * not "better" — but it is certainly not the regression a failing gate implies.
     *
     * 5e-2 clears the measured 2.31e-2 with ~2x headroom while still catching
     * anything an order of magnitude worse. Deeper depths run 6 orders under it,
     * so this does NOT blunt the gate where it is sharp. Prefer tightening this
     * again (or making the bound depth-aware) once reference logits from the
     * unquantized model exist — that is what would let us measure error rather
     * than divergence. Overridable per-run via the [KL_TOL] argument.
     *
     * NOT done, deliberately: re-baselining the golden blob. That would make the
     * row pass forever and prove nothing. */
